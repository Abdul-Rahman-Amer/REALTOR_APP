This exceptional flex 2 bedroom apartment is a true masterpiece of modern living. The exquisite design is inspired by the vibrant art, fashion, and music scene of Downtown from the 70s and 80s, bringing a unique blend of elegance and urban charm to your doorstep.

Inside, you'll find Italian kitchens by Stevali, with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances, as well as sustainable wood floors that add a touch of natural warmth to the space. The bedrooms are spacious and airy, offering plenty of room for relaxation and rest. And with ample natural light pouring in through the large windows, you'll always feel energized and uplifted.

But the real magic happens outside your apartment door. The amenities are truly world-class, with a fitness center, yoga studio, and Peloton cycle stations that cater to all your workout needs. The Penthouse-level Resident's Club is an urban oasis, with custom billiards and poker tables, private wine and spirits storage, and furnishings designed by Jimmie Martin of London. And as you step outside onto the landscaped terrace overlooking the city, you'll feel as though you've been transported to another world.

The location is equally impressive, with a wealth of new shops and restaurants to explore, including Augustine, Eataly, and Whole Foods (coming soon). From Blue Ribbon Federal Grill to Nobu Downtown, there's always something delicious to indulge in. With easy access to all modes of transportation, including the A, C, J, Z, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and PATH trains, you'll have the world at your fingertips., you'll never have to worry about missing out on the best of what the city has to offer.
